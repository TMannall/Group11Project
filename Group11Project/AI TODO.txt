AI to do:


- When AI's hull is destroyed, combat encounter ends & rewards distributed to player. 

- Need general game over state, with option to play again or return to menu.
- Have game over state with 2 possible versions: game over win, and game over lose 

- Maybe need general success state too? So it goes encounter state -> success state -> map state & repeat


- CombatEvent shouldn't start until combat message has been presented to player and they press OK to begin
- AI should then wait until player has attacked first before beginning the encounter



-------Testing needed:---------

- AI and player cannon reloads seem to be sharing the same clock? Player cannot fire their own cannons on the AI. 
- THINK AI/PLAYER INTERACTION IS FIXED NOW; WILL NEED TO TEST THOROUGHLY LATER

- AI's target should detect if it's been destroyed (isTargetable) or not before selecting it as a target
- As above, AI's actual attack target should detect if it's been destroyed before attacking it
