AI to do:

- AI's target should detect if it's been destroyed (isTargetable) or not before selecting it as a target
- As above, AI's actual attack target should detect if it's been destroyed before attacking it

- When AI's hull is destroyed, combat encounter ends & rewards distributed to player. 

- Need general game over state, with option to play again or return to menu.
- Have game over state with 2 possible versions: game over win, and game over lose 

- Maybe need general success state too? So it goes encounter state -> success state -> map state & repeat


-------Testing needed:---------

- AI and player cannon reloads seem to be sharing the same clock? Player cannot fire their own cannons on the AI. 
- THINK AI/PLAYER INTERACTION IS FIXED NOW; WILL NEED TO TEST THOROUGHLY LATER
